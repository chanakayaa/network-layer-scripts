**Network Layer Bypass Scripts for 802.1x Authentication**

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to target and bypass various network security measures at the network layer. These scripts focus on bypassing 802.1x authentication and performing attacks such as VLAN Hopping, MAC Flooding, CDP Flooding, and 802.1x downgrade attacks. They are intended for educational and research purposes to demonstrate vulnerabilities in network security configurations.

### Included Scripts:
- **VLAN Hopping**: Exploits VLAN misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to different VLANs.
- **MAC Flooding**: Floods a switch with bogus MAC addresses, potentially leading to a switch failure or traffic redirection.
- **CDP Flooding**: Overloads the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) with excessive traffic to impact network devices.
- **802.1x Downgrade Attack**: Downgrades 802.1x security protocols, potentially leading to weaker security postures and easier network access.

### Usage:
Each script is designed for specific network scenarios. Please refer to the individual script documentation for setup, requirements, and usage instructions.

### Disclaimer:
These scripts are provided for research and educational purposes only. Misuse of these scripts in any unauthorized environment may lead to severe legal consequences. Ensure that you have explicit permission from the network owner before using any of these tools.
